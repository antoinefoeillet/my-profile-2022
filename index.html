								<h2> Studies </h2>
								
								<p>	
									Originally from New York, then living in England and finally in France, I had the opportunity from a very young age to discover many different cultures and to develop my ability to adapt. These abilities have been developed by going through different school systems.  I started my schooling in the English system when I was younger before moving to France. This change allowed me to discover the French system in which I finished my education by obtaining my high school diploma. Once obtained I had the opportunity to enter the "bachelor in international business" program of IESEG. In order to widen my cultural and professional opening.

									<h2> work </h2>
									<p>
									Endowed with a desire to work from a very young age, I had the opportunity to try different types of jobs that all offered me very different but very rewarding experiences. I first decided to get interested in the fashion world by creating a first company of purchase and resale of exclusive products. This gave me the opportunity to discover the sales environment, the customer contact but also the international market and digital marketing. After that I decided to stay in the service industry because it is a field that interests me and where it was possible to work on the human contact and the customer experience. I started as an assistant bartender and then moved on to become a bartender, runner, head waiter and training manager for new employees. I then started in a new sector due to the restrictions. During one year I had the opportunity to work for the company direct result where I started as a canvasser for associations such as amnestie international or the red cross but also for commercial companies. I was able to work on my sales skills before climbing the ladder to become a trainer and team captain before leaving this company to launch myself into the world of entrepreneurship as an event organizer. In parallel in 2022 I had the opportunity to work for the company Linkfluence in the marketing sector. it is a company specialized in the analysis of social networks through different artificial intelligence.  Thanks to my previous experiences I was able to finalize my internship by working on the organization of their first customer event in Paris. Where all their most important customers were present.

									Having a childhood immersed in sports, I had the opportunity to practice many different physical activities such as tennis, soccer, basketball, swimming or sliding sports. I was lucky enough to be able to practice swimming and skiing in competition. The swimming thanks to the racing club of France which initiated me to this world then thanks to the stade francais to the ski which carried me to a regional level. This allowed me to work on my learning abilities as well as my competitive spirit in the hope of winning. I still practice many sports on a daily basis at a very high level in order to keep a healthy lifestyle.
